Description: Performs sensitivity analysis for publication bias in meta-analyses
    (per Mathur & VanderWeele, 2020 [<doi:10.31219/osf.io/s9dp6>]). These analyses
    enable statements such as: "For publication bias to shift the observed point
    estimate to the null, 'significant' results would need to be at least
    30-fold more likely to be published than negative or 'nonsignificant'
    results." Comparable statements can be made regarding shifting to a chosen
    non-null value or shifting the confidence interval. Provides a worst-case
    meta-analytic point estimate under maximal publication bias obtained simply
    by conducting a standard meta-analysis of only the negative and
    "nonsignificant" studies.
